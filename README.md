📍 Future Location Prediction System


📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an industrial machine learning application using Dataiku Data Science Studio (DSS).
The goal is to predict the future location of users based on their historical GPS data.

The project simulates an end-to-end ML workflow similar to how real-world organizations leverage DSS for scalable AI solutions.

📂 Dataset

Dataset: Location Dataset (CSV)

Features: Latitude, Longitude, Timestamp, User ID, etc.

Target: Predict the future location of a user.

⚙️ Project Workflow

Data Ingestion – Import dataset into DSS.

Data Preparation – Clean data, handle missing values, and create time & spatial features.

Feature Engineering – Extract patterns from user movement (time intervals, transitions).

Modeling – Train supervised ML models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Evaluation – Compare models using DSS metrics & visualizations.

Deployment – Deploy best model as a prediction service.

Visualization – Create dashboards for insights and predictions.
